# Classification project
This repository contains machine learning models and data analysis focused on classification tasks. It includes detailed notebooks showcasing the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
## Files 
- project.ipynb: Main notebook that contains the implementation of a machine learning classification model. It covers:
    - Data loading and preprocessing.
    - Feature engineering and selection.
    - Model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
- project_PabloTejero.ipynb: An extended version of the project notebook, including additional exploration, optimizations, and personalized insights related to model performance and feature importance.
- Report_PabloTejero.pdf: Detailed report documenting the methodology, results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
